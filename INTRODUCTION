Autonomous drones are widely used in agriculture, surveillance, and logistics. One of the primary challenges in autonomous drone navigation is avoiding obstacles while reaching a target location efficiently. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising approach where the drone learns from experience, improving its navigation strategy without human intervention.
