1.	Design a 3D simulation environment with randomly placed obstacles and a target location.
2.	Implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to learn the best navigation policy.
3.	Train the agent using reinforcement learning, where it receives rewards based on its actions.
4.	Evaluate the agentâ€™s performance through multiple training episodes.
